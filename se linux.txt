SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) is a security feature in Red Hat-based Linux distributions that provides a mandatory access control (MAC) mechanism to enhance the system's security. The SELinux configuration is typically stored in the /etc/selinux/config file.

To configure SELinux on Red Hat-based systems, follow these steps:

Check Current SELinux Status:
Open a terminal and run the following command to check the current status of SELinux:

bash
Copy code
sestatus
Edit SELinux Configuration:
Open the SELinux configuration file /etc/selinux/config in a text editor. You may use a command-line text editor like vi or nano. For example:

bash
Copy code
sudo vi /etc/selinux/config

enforcing: SELinux is fully active and enforcing security policies.
permissive: SELinux is active but only generates log messages and does not enforce policies.
disabled: SELinux is completely disabled.
Choose the appropriate mode and update the line accordingly. For example, to set SELinux to enforcing mode:

makefile
Copy code
SELINUX=enforcing
Configure SELinux Policy:
There is another line in the configuration file that specifies the SELinux policy. The default policy is usually targeted, but you can change it if needed:

makefile
Copy code
SELINUXTYPE=targeted
Save and Exit:
Save the changes and exit the text editor.

Reboot the System:
After modifying the SELinux configuration, it is recommended to reboot th
