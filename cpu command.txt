Process Management and Monitoring Commands
Managing and monitoring processes are essential tasks for system administrators and users to ensure optimal system performance, resource utilization, and stability. Understanding the available commands for process management and monitoring helps in troubleshooting issues, identifying resource-intensive tasks, and managing system resources effectively. Here's an overview of some essential commands related to process management and monitoring in Linux:

1. Process Management Commands:
ps (Process Status):

Display information about active processes.
bash
Copy code
ps aux  # Display all processes for all users with detailed information
top:

Display real-time system processes and resource utilization.
bash
Copy code
top  # Display dynamic view of system processes and resource usage
htop:

Interactive process viewer with a colorful and user-friendly interface.
bash
Copy code
htop  # Launch interactive process viewer
kill:

Terminate a process by sending a signal.
bash
Copy code
kill <PID>  # Terminate process by Process ID (PID)
kill -9 <PID>  # Forcefully terminate process by PID
pkill and pgrep:

Find or signal processes based on name or other attributes.
bash
Copy code
pkill -f <process_name>  # Terminate processes based on name pattern
pgrep <process_name>  # List PIDs of processes based on name pattern
nice and renice:

Set or modify process priority (niceness).
bash
Copy code
nice -n <value> <command>  # Run command with a specific niceness value
renice <value> <PID>  # Change niceness value of a running process
2. Process Monitoring and Analysis:
vmstat:

Report information about system processes, memory, paging, block IO, traps, and CPU activity.
bash
Copy code
vmstat 1  # Display system statistics every 1 second
iostat:

Report CPU and input/output statistics for devices and partitions.
bash
Copy code
iostat -x  # Display extended statistics for devices
sar:

Collect, report, and save system activity information.
bash
Copy code
sar -u 1 5  # Report CPU activity every 1 second, 5 times
strace:

Trace system calls and signals for a running process to debug issues.
bash
Copy code
strace -p <PID>  # Trace system calls for a specific process by PID
lsof:

List open files and the processes that opened them, useful for identifying processes holding onto deleted files.
bash
Copy code
lsof -i  # List processes using internet sockets
