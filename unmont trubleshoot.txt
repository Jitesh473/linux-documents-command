When trying to unmounting it is not unmounting, how to troubleshoot this one?
Some times directory reflects error while unmounting because,
(i) you are in the same directory and trying to unmount it, check with # pwdcommand.
(ii) some users are present or accessing the same directory and using the contents in it, check this with
# fuser -cu <device name> (to check the users who are accessing that partition)
# lsof <device name> (to check the files which are open in that mount point)
# fuser -ck <opened file name with path> (to kill that opened files)
Now we can unmount that partition using # umount <mount point>
