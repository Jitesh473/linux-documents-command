Summary	Install and configure Samba to share files across a network.
Categories	server
Difficulty	1
Author	Aden Padilla adenpadilla@gmail.com
Overview
Duration: 1:00

A Samba file server enables file sharing across different operating systems over a network. It lets you access your desktop files from a laptop and share files with Windows and macOS users.

This guide covers the installation and configuration of Samba on Ubuntu.

What you’ll learn
How to set up a Samba file server
How to share files across a local network
What you’ll need
Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
A Local Area Network (LAN) to share files over
If you have everything ready, let’s dive straight into the installation process on the next step!

Originally authored by Aden Padilla.

Installing Samba
Duration: 1:00

To install Samba, we run:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install samba
We can check if the installation was successful by running:

whereis samba
The following should be its output:

samba: /usr/sbin/samba /usr/lib/samba /etc/samba /usr/share/samba /usr/share/man/man7/samba.7.gz /usr/share/man/man8/samba.8.gz
Setting up Samba
Duration: 2:00

Now that Samba is installed, we need to create a directory for it to share:

mkdir /home/<username>/sambashare/
The command above creates a new folder sambashare in our home directory which we will share later.

The configuration file for Samba is located at /etc/samba/smb.conf. To add the new directory as a share, we edit the file by running:

sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
At the bottom of the file, add the following lines:

[sambashare]
    comment = Samba on Ubuntu
    path = /home/username/sambashare
    read only = no
    browsable = yes
Then press Ctrl-O to save and Ctrl-X to exit from the nano text editor.

What we’ve just added
comment: A brief description of the share.
path: The directory of our share.

read only: Permission to modify the contents of the share folder is only granted when the value of this directive is no.

browsable: When set to yes, file managers such as Ubuntu’s default file manager will list this share under “Network” (it could also appear as browseable).

Now that we have our new share configured, save it and restart Samba for it to take effect:

sudo service smbd restart
Update the firewall rules to allow Samba traffic:

sudo ufw allow samba
Setting up User Accounts and Connecting to Share
Duration: 1:00

Since Samba doesn’t use the system account password, we need to set up a Samba password for our user account:

sudo smbpasswd -a username
ⓘ Note
Username used must belong to a system account, else it won’t save.

Connecting to Share
On Ubuntu: Open up the default file manager and click Connect to Server then enter: ubuntuctn

On macOS: In the Finder menu, click Go > Connect to Server then enter: macosctn

On Windows, open up File Manager and edit the file path to:

\\ip-address\sambashare
Note: ip-address is the Samba server IP address and sambashare is the name of the share.

You’ll be prompted for your credentials. Enter them to connect! Samba

Please include the following

sudo smbpasswd -e username
after the line

sudo smbpasswd -a username
Reason: the -e command ENABLES the user (followed tutorial and it didn’t work without that in Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

Please change the following as the first change to the /etc/samba/smb.conf file. It should appear before the addition of the sambashare lines.

In the Share Definitions section under the [homes] section:

read only = no
create mask = 0775
directory mask = 0775

The above changes are required to allow Win 10 to write to the share.

[sambashare] 
   comment = Samba on Ubuntu 
   path = /home/username/sambashare
   read only = no 
   browsable = yes
That’s probably a typo and should be browseable, at least that’s how it’s written in the example:

[printers]
   comment = All Printers
   browseable = no
   path = /var/spool/samba
   printable = yes
   guest ok = no
   read only = yes
   create mask = 0700

The provided Samba configuration is outdated and incorrect. Many new changes have been made which makes those setting invalid. Here are the correct settings (works with Windows):

[ Movies]
comment = Movies on Red Tail
path = /mnt/share/movies
read only = no
browsable = yes
public = yes
force user = root
write list = root
create mask = 0775
directory mask = 0775
acl allow execute always = True

In config file we have this line

[sambashare]
I think for a newbies, we should also write why we wrote this particular line.

Agreed. Also if it could be a different name from the directory being shared, that would be helpful for newer users. I ran into a problem where it wasn’t obvious whether the share name (\ip[this part here) came from the directory’s name or the [sambashare] part. This was only relevant because I was trying to share a folder that wasn’t named ‘sambashare’.

I’d like to suggest telling people they will need wsdd if they want their Linux Samba shares to be visible on Windows. I know wsdd is not part of the Samba project but it (or an equivalent) is essential for most users and not telling them up-front to install it just leads to frustration and unnecessary help requests about “Samba doesn’t work with Windows clients” etc.

sudo apt install wsdd is sufficient for most users on a local network (by default wsdd listens on all interfaces, but can be configured via /etc/default/wsdd).

I suggest to extend the Note in section “Connecting to Share”:
Note: ip-address is the Samba server IP address or ‘your-computers-name.local’ in a local area network (or for a virtual machine on the same computer). sambashare is the name of the share.

Agreed. I struggled with it until I found that the user account needs to be enabled first, from here: Samba/SambaServerGuide - Community Help Wiki 10

I see this @duncancosser’s comment has been posted about 3 years back, but still the change hasn’t been added yet as of November 2023’

Thanks
